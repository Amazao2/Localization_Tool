<h1>CS4482a: TOOLS 2 – Language and Localization</h1>

This project is a simple tool to allow game designers to add text to a game within the Unity
Game Engine and have it exported to a CSV for a translator to translate the text to other
natural languages. The purpose of this project was to learn how to create tools in Unity by
extending the editor.

WARNING: Code formatting and comments are almost non-existant. Functionality and learning the
engine's interface where the primary concern on this small project. I may revisit the code and
add comments in the future as a learning exercise.

</br>TOOLS 2 – Language and Localization

<b>1 Introduction</b>

Not everybody in the world speaks English. It’s very likely that, if you want your game
to be successful, you will realease you game in North America, Japan, Europe, and all
manner of foreign country. Usually, you will want to ensure the gamers in these countries
understand what your game is all about. This is where localization comes in. You have to
create a system that will not only ease editing of text, but also allow the game to switch
seamlessly between languages. Your system should do the following:

<ol type=1>
  <li>Use the Unity3D Editor API to create your tools.</li>
  <li>Define language data, and write an editor that makes them easily modifiable.</li>
  <li>Write a Unity Behaviour that implements your language data, and shows functionality
    of switching the languages.</li>
  <li>Hint: It doesn’t have to be perfect, and you can cut corners, putting everything in a
    single scene.</li>
</ol>

<b>2 Miscellaneous</b>

If you would like to write your tools in another system, SDK, C# (WPF), or otherwise,
that’s OK too, but please send me an e-mail and we’ll discuss other options.
